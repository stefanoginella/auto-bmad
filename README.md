Fully automated BMAD pipeline orchestration using multiple AI CLIs in parallel. Runs stories through 14+ steps across 7 phases with multi-AI consensus reviews — designed for unattended, sandboxed execution.

- **4 AI providers** (Claude, GPT, Copilot, OpenCode) running review steps in parallel
- **14+ pipeline steps** across 7 phases per story — from story creation to documentation
- **4-way parallel multi-AI reviews** with argument-quality arbiter (fan-out + merge)
- **Full epic orchestration** with automatic PR, CI gating, and squash-merge between stories

> **Warning:** By default, these scripts execute AI agents with full filesystem access (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--full-auto`, `--yolo`). Run only in isolated environments (VM, container, etc), or use `--safe-mode` to let each AI tool prompt for permissions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and copy (or symlink) scripts into your BMAD project root
git clone https://github.com/user/auto-bmad.git
cp -p auto-bmad/auto-bmad-story.sh auto-bmad/auto-bmad-epic.sh /path/to/your/project/

# 2. Edit the AI profiles and step assignments at the top of auto-bmad-story.sh

# 3. Run a single story
./auto-bmad-story.sh

# 4. Run an entire epic
./auto-bmad-epic.sh
```

The story script auto-detects the next story from `sprint-status.yaml`. The epic script loops through all stories in an epic, handling PR + CI + merge between them. See [How It Works](#how-it-works) for the full picture.

## How It Works

This project is opinionated — it assumes a specific git workflow (branch-per-story, squash-merge PRs, CI gates) and uses multiple AI CLIs simultaneously. The entire pipeline is defined in two shell scripts with plain configuration at the top — edit the AI profiles, step assignments, or git workflow to fit your setup.

Two scripts work together:

| Script | Scope | What it does |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `auto-bmad-story.sh` | One story | Runs a single story through the full BMAD pipeline (14+ steps, 7 phases) using multiple AI CLIs |
| `auto-bmad-epic.sh` | One epic | Loops through all stories in an epic, delegating each to the story script, with PR + CI between stories |

### Multi-AI Review Pattern

Reviews (validation, adversarial, edge cases, code review) use a **4-way parallel review + arbiter** pattern:

1. Four AI reviewers run independently in parallel (GPT, MiniMax, MiMo, Claude)
2. Each produces a findings report saved to the story artifacts directory
3. An arbiter (Claude Opus) cross-references all findings, groups overlapping issues, and evaluates each on **argument quality** — not vote count:

| Evaluation | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **Clear bug** (concrete failure path) | Fix immediately |
| **Substantive** (real impact on correctness/security/perf) | Fix if argument is sound |
| **Speculative/stylistic** (hypothetical, preference-based) | Skip |
| **Out of scope** | Skip |

Reviewer agreement is recorded as context (e.g., "flagged by 3/4") but is not the decision criteria. A single well-argued finding with a concrete code path outweighs multiple vague flags.

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Bash** 3.2+
- **Git** repository with a `main` branch
- **BMad framework** installed (`_bmad/` directory) — tested against BMad 6.2.0 / TEA 1.7.1
- **Sprint status** generated at `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`

### AI CLIs (all three needed for full parallel reviews)

- [`claude`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — Claude Code CLI
- [`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex) — OpenAI Codex CLI
- [`opencode`](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) — OpenCode CLI (MiniMax, MiMo)
- [`copilot`](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli) — GitHub Copilot CLI (supported but not assigned to any step)

### For auto-merge between stories

- [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) — GitHub CLI, authenticated

> **Note:** Each story runs 14+ AI invocations across 4 providers. This is extremely token-hungry — budget accordingly.

## Installation

The scripts must live in the root of your BMAD project (they derive `PROJECT_ROOT` from their own location).

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/user/auto-bmad.git

# Copy scripts into your project root (preserves executable bit)
cp -p auto-bmad/auto-bmad-story.sh auto-bmad/auto-bmad-epic.sh /path/to/your/project/

# — or symlink to stay in sync with upstream —
ln -s "$(pwd)/auto-bmad/auto-bmad-story.sh" /path/to/your/project/auto-bmad-story.sh
ln -s "$(pwd)/auto-bmad/auto-bmad-epic.sh" /path/to/your/project/auto-bmad-epic.sh

# Verify
./auto-bmad-story.sh --help
./auto-bmad-epic.sh --help
```

## Story Pipeline (`auto-bmad-story.sh`)

Automates one story through the full BMAD implementation workflow.

### Usage

```bash
./auto-bmad-story.sh [options]

Options:
  --story STORY_ID       Override auto-detection (e.g., 1-2-database-schemas)
  --from-step STEP_ID    Resume from a specific step (e.g., 3.1, 7.1)
  --dry-run              Preview all steps without executing
  --skip-epic-phases     Skip phases 0 and 6 even at epic boundaries
  --skip-tea             Skip TEA phases even if installed (0, 2.1, 5.x, 6.1-6.3)
  --skip-reviews         Skip all parallel review + arbiter phases (1.2-1.5, 3.x, 4.x)
  --fast-reviews         Run only GPT reviewer per phase, skip arbiter
  --skip-git             Skip git write ops (branch, checkpoint, squash)
  --no-traces            Remove pipeline artifacts after finalization
                         (pipeline report is kept)
  --safe-mode            Disable permission-bypass flags (AI tools prompt for approval)
  --help                 Show usage
```

### Pipeline Phases

| Phase | Steps | Name | What happens |
|-------|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 | Epic Start | TEA Test Design at epic level. *Only runs on the first story in an epic.* |
| 1 | 1, 2a-2e, 3a-3e | Story Preparation | Create story, validate (4 AIs + arbiter), adversarial review (4 AIs + arbiter) |
| 2 | 4, 5 | TDD + Implementation | Generate failing acceptance tests (red phase), then implement (green phase) |
| 3 | 6a-6e | Edge Cases | 4 parallel edge case hunters + arbiter applies fixes |
| 4 | 7a-7e, 8 | Code Review | 4 parallel code reviewers + arbiter applies fixes |
| 5 | 9, 10 | Traceability | Testarch trace + test automation expansion |
| 6 | 11a-11c, 12, 13 | Epic End | Epic trace/NFR/test review, retrospective, project context. *Only runs on the last story in an epic.* |
| 7 | 14a, 14b | Finalization | Tech writer documents story, scrum master closes it |

### AI Profiles

Seven AI profiles are assigned to different steps based on the task:

| Profile | CLI / Model | Effort | Used for |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|
| `AI_OPUS` | Claude Opus 4.6 | max | Critical path, code-touching arbiters, implementation |
| `AI_OPUS_HIGH` | Claude Opus 4.6 | high | Structured, non-critical (pre-impl arbiters, retro, docs) |
| `AI_SONNET` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | high | Lightweight bookkeeping (traceability, closing) |
| `AI_GPT` | Codex GPT 5.4 | xhigh | Code reviews, edge cases |
| `AI_GPT_HIGH` | Codex GPT 5.4 | high | Spec-level reviews (pre-implementation) |
| `AI_MINIMAX` | OpenCode MiniMax M2.5 | max | Parallel reviews |
| `AI_MIMO` | OpenCode MiMo V2 Pro | max | Parallel reviews |

> **Note:** `AI_COPILOT` (Copilot Gemini 3 Pro) is defined but commented out — Gemini reviews were consistently low quality.

### Story Detection

Auto-detects the next story from `sprint-status.yaml`:
1. Prioritizes stories with status `in-progress` (resume interrupted work)
2. Falls back to the first story with status `backlog`
3. Epic boundary detection is automatic based on story position

### Git Workflow

The story script creates a `story/{STORY_ID}` branch from `main` at the start. During execution, each phase commits a checkpoint (`wip(1-1): phase N - name`) so work is recoverable if the pipeline fails mid-run. At the end, all checkpoint commits are squashed into a single commit using the conventional-commit message from the story file's Auto-bmad Completion section.

### Artifacts

Per-story artifacts are saved to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/auto-bmad/{SHORT_ID}/`:
- Review findings from each AI (`*-validate-*.md`, `*-adversarial-*.md`, `*-edge-cases-*.md`, `*-review-*.md`)
- Arbiter decision reports (`*-arbiter-*.md`)
- Pipeline log (`pipeline.log`) — append-only run record with timestamps, CLI/model per step, phase markers, and a completion summary with wall/compute time and git diff stats

### Review Modes

The pipeline runs 4 parallel reviewers (GPT, MiniMax, MiMo, Claude) per review phase, then an arbiter synthesizes findings. Two flags control this:

- **`--fast-reviews`** — Run only the GPT reviewer (highest signal), skip the arbiter. Cuts 16 AI calls down to ~4. Good for iteration.
- **`--skip-reviews`** — Skip all review phases entirely. Pipeline becomes: create story → implement → document → close. Supersedes `--fast-reviews` if both are passed.

### Safe Mode (`--safe-mode`)

Disables the permission-bypass flags (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--full-auto`, `--yolo`) so each AI CLI uses its native permission prompting. The pipeline will pause at each step for user approval instead of running unattended.

Useful for:
- **First run on a new codebase** — review what each AI step does before trusting it
- **After model updates** — verify behavior hasn't shifted
- **Combined with `--skip-git`** — the most conservative possible run (`--safe-mode --skip-git`)

### No Traces Mode (`--no-traces`)

Removes all pipeline-generated artifacts after finalization — review reports, arbiter reports, the entire `auto-bmad/{SHORT_ID}/` directory. The pipeline report is preserved at `auto-bmad/pipeline-report--{SHORT_ID}.md`.

This is useful when the review reports have already been indexed into the story file and you don't want leftover pipeline files in the repo.

### Resume on Failure

Each phase is checkpointed as a git commit, so if the pipeline fails you won't lose prior phases. The script exits with a resume command:

```
Resume: ./auto-bmad-story.sh --from-step 6a --story 1-2-database-schemas
```

See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for common failure scenarios.

## Epic Pipeline (`auto-bmad-epic.sh`)

Thin orchestration wrapper that runs all stories in an epic sequentially.

### Usage

```bash
./auto-bmad-epic.sh [options]

Options:
  --epic EPIC_ID         Target epic number (e.g., 1). Auto-detects if omitted.
  --from-story ID        Resume from a specific story (e.g., 1-3-some-slug)
  --dry-run              Preview the full epic plan without executing
  --no-merge             Skip auto-PR/merge between stories (manual git)
  --help                 Show usage

Story pass-through flags (forwarded to auto-bmad-story.sh):
  --skip-epic-phases     Skip phases 0 (epic start) and 6 (epic end)
  --skip-tea             Skip TEA phases even if installed
  --skip-reviews         Skip all parallel review + arbiter phases
  --fast-reviews         Run only GPT reviewer per phase, skip arbiter
  --skip-git             Skip git write ops (branch, checkpoint, squash)
  --no-traces            Remove pipeline artifacts after finalization
  --safe-mode            Disable permission-bypass flags (AI tools prompt for approval)
```

### What It Does

1. **Parses `sprint-status.yaml`** to collect all stories for the target epic
2. **Loops sequentially** — calls `./auto-bmad-story.sh --story STORY_ID` for each
3. **PR + auto-merge between stories** — after each story completes:
   - Commits changes on the story branch
   - Pushes and creates a PR via `gh`
   - Enables auto-merge (squash)
   - Polls CI check states every 30s until all checks resolve
   - Switches to `main` after merge
4. **Tracks epic-level metrics** — per-story durations, total wall time
5. **Prints retrospective summary** — after the last story, parses the retrospective output for action items and significant discovery alerts

### Epic Detection

When `--epic` is omitted:
1. Finds the first epic with `in-progress` status in sprint-status.yaml
2. Falls back to the first epic with `backlog` status

### Story Filtering

- Stories with status `done` are skipped
- `--from-story` skips all stories before the specified one (for resuming)

### Git Workflow Between Stories

```
Story completes on story/1-1-slug branch
  (phase checkpoints already squashed into single commit by story script)
  → git push -u origin story/1-1-slug
  → gh pr create --title "feat(epic-1): 1-1-slug"
  → gh pr merge --auto --squash
  → poll until merged (15 min timeout)
  → git checkout main && git pull
  → git branch -d story/1-1-slug
Next story starts from main
```

With `--no-merge`: skips all git operations between stories. Use this for manual git control or non-GitHub workflows.

### Commit Messages

Both scripts extract the conventional commit message that the tech writer (step 14a) places in the story file's `## Auto-bmad Completion` section. The story script squashes all phase checkpoints into this single commit. Falls back to `feat(SHORT_ID): <description from slug>`.

### Failure Handling

**Story pipeline failure:**
```
Epic 1 — STORY FAILED

  Failed story:      1-3-ci-pipeline (story 3 of 5)
  Stories completed: 2/5

  Resume (story):  ./auto-bmad-story.sh --story 1-3-ci-pipeline --from-step <step>
  Resume (epic):   ./auto-bmad-epic.sh --epic 1 --from-story 1-3-ci-pipeline
```

**CI failure on PR:**
```
  ✗ CI failed on PR for story 1-2-database-schemas (2 failed, 3 passed)
    PR: https://github.com/.../pull/42

    Fix CI, merge the PR manually, then resume:
    ./auto-bmad-epic.sh --epic 1 --from-story 1-3-ci-pipeline
```

### Retrospective Summary

After the last story completes (which triggers the retrospective via Phase 6), the epic script parses the retrospective file and prints:
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Critical path blockers
- Significant discovery alerts (if the retrospective flagged issues that may invalidate the next epic)

This is informational — no blocking gate. Review before starting the next epic.

### Artifacts

Epic-level artifacts go to `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/auto-bmad/epic-{N}/`:
- `epic-{N}-metrics.md` — per-story timing table and totals
- `epic-pipeline.log` — full log (deleted on success)

## Sprint Status Format

Both scripts read from `sprint-status.yaml`:

```yaml
epic-1: in-progress
1-1-monorepo-setup: done
1-2-database-schemas: in-progress
1-3-ci-pipeline: backlog
epic-1-retrospective: optional

epic-2: backlog
2-1-source-crud: backlog
2-2-health-monitoring: backlog
epic-2-retrospective: optional
```

**Status values:**

| Type | Statuses |
|------|----------|
| Epic | `backlog` → `in-progress` → `done` |
| Story | `backlog` → `ready-for-dev` → `in-progress` → `review` → `done` |
| Retrospective | `optional` ↔ `done` |

## Customization

Both scripts keep all configuration in clearly marked blocks at the top — fork and edit to fit your setup.

### AI Profiles

Edit the `AI_*` variables at the top of `auto-bmad-story.sh`. Format: `"cli|model|effort"`.

```bash
# Example: swap MiniMax for a different OpenCode model
AI_MINIMAX="opencode|opencode/some-other-model|max"
```

### Step Assignment

Edit `step_config()` in `auto-bmad-story.sh` to reassign steps to different AI profiles. Step IDs use a consistent scheme:

- **Numeric** (0, 1, 4, 5, ...) — sequential steps, run one at a time
- **Letter suffix** (2a, 2c, 2d, 2e) — parallel slots within a phase (a=GPT, c=MiniMax, d=MiMo, e=Claude)
- **Numeric after parallel** (3, 8) — arbiter that runs after parallel slots complete

### Git / CI Configuration

Edit these variables at the top of `auto-bmad-epic.sh`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PR_SAFETY_TIMEOUT` | `7200` (2 hours) | Backstop for stuck CI runners — not the normal control flow |
| `PR_POLL_INTERVAL` | `30` | Seconds between CI status checks |

Use `--no-merge` to skip all git operations between stories for non-GitHub or manual workflows.

## Troubleshooting

### AI CLI not found

The scripts check for `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, and `opencode` in PATH at startup. Verify each is installed:

```bash
for cli in claude codex copilot opencode; do command -v "$cli" >/dev/null && echo "$cli ✓" || echo "$cli ✗"; done
```

### BMAD version mismatch

The story script validates against BMad / TEA versions. A mismatch produces a warning but does not block execution. Update the `BMAD_BUILD_VERSION` and `BMAD_BUILD_TEA_VERSION` variables if you are running a different BMad version.

### Story pipeline fails mid-step

Use `--from-step` to resume from the failed step:

```bash
./auto-bmad-story.sh --story 1-2-database-schemas --from-step 6a
```

### CI failure or stuck checks

If CI fails, the epic script stops immediately with a link to the PR. If CI appears stuck (runners hung, orphaned checks), the 2-hour safety timeout will eventually fire. Fix CI manually, merge the PR, then resume:

```bash
./auto-bmad-epic.sh --epic 1 --from-story 1-3-ci-pipeline
```

### sprint-status.yaml not found

Both scripts expect this file at `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`. Generate it through the BMad framework before running auto-bmad.

## Examples

```bash
# Preview what the next epic would do
./auto-bmad-epic.sh --dry-run

# Run epic 1 end-to-end
./auto-bmad-epic.sh --epic 1

# Resume epic after a story failure
./auto-bmad-epic.sh --epic 1 --from-story 1-3-ci-pipeline

# Run without auto-PR (manual git between stories)
./auto-bmad-epic.sh --epic 1 --no-merge

# Run a single story manually
./auto-bmad-story.sh --story 1-2-database-schemas

# Resume a failed story from a specific step
./auto-bmad-story.sh --story 1-2-database-schemas --from-step 6a

# Preview a single story's pipeline
./auto-bmad-story.sh --story 1-2-database-schemas --dry-run

# Quick run — single reviewer, no arbiter
./auto-bmad-story.sh --fast-reviews

# Minimal pipeline — create, implement, close (no reviews or TEA)
./auto-bmad-story.sh --skip-reviews --skip-tea

# Run clean — no pipeline artifacts left behind
./auto-bmad-story.sh --no-traces

# Epic with fast reviews for all stories
./auto-bmad-epic.sh --epic 1 --fast-reviews

# Safe mode — AI tools prompt for permissions instead of auto-approving
./auto-bmad-story.sh --safe-mode

# Cautious first run — safe mode + no git writes
./auto-bmad-story.sh --safe-mode --skip-git
```

## Lineage

This project evolved from the original **auto-bmad** Claude Code plugin that lived in this same repository. The plugin approach was replaced with the current standalone shell scripts to support multi-CLI orchestration and epic-level automation.

An improved fork of the original plugin is maintained at [bramvera/auto-bmad](https://github.com/bramvera/auto-bmad).
